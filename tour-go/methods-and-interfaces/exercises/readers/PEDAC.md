# Readers

## Problem

Implement a `Reader` type that emits an infinite stream of the ASCII character `'A'`.

### Understanding

`Reader` based on `io` package.
- Any type that implements the `Reader` interface can be accessed through it.

`"strings"` implements a `Read` method

Can create an 'infinite stream' with an infinite loop
